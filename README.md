# dont-forget-the-tea

The idea here is to build a grocery list app for the retreat (so we don't forget the tea ever again).

There are no limitations in regards to tech used, things tried etc., do whatever you want basically. We can also use several things - e.g. we could write the backend in three different languages and load-balance between them, as long as the API is the same, it's fine. :D

Have fun! :)
